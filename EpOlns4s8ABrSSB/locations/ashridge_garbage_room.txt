name: Garbage Room
description: The garbage room is a cramped, dimly lit space dedicated to waste. The air hangs heavy with the unmistakable stench of decaying refuse, a pungent mix of stale food, damp cardboard, and unidentifiable grime. Piles of overflowing trash bags lean precariously against the walls, threatening to spill their contents onto the stained concrete floor.
