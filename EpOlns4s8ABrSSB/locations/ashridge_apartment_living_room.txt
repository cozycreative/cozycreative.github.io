name: Living Room
description: The living room is cramped, but you've made it your own. A lumpy, well-worn sofa dominates one wall, its floral pattern faded with age. Opposite it, a small, boxy television hums quietly, its screen perpetually dusty. A chipped coffee table holds a haphazard stack of magazines â€“ mostly outdated, but comforting in their familiarity. A single window, grimy with city soot, offers a sliver of natural light, barely cutting through the gloom. The walls are a patchwork of peeling wallpaper and half-hearted paint jobs, a testament to years of neglect.
