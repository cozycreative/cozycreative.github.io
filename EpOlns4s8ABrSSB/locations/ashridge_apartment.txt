name: Your Apartment
description: Your modest apartment in the Ashridge district. While small, it's a place to call your own. The rent is affordable, and the location is convenient. The walls could use a fresh coat of paint, and some of the fixtures are dated, but it's clean and functional. A small thermostat on the wall controls the heating, and a window AC unit helps during summer months.
