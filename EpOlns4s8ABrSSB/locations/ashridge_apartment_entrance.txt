name: Apartment Entrance
description: The entrance to the "Affordable Apartments" building. The doorway is framed by faded red brick, worn smooth by countless hands brushing past. A flickering fluorescent bulb casts a harsh light on the cracked linoleum just inside, hinting at the modest lives contained within. The air smells faintly of stale cigarettes and simmering cabbage.
