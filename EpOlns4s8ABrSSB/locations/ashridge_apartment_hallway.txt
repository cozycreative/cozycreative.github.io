name: Hallway
description: A narrow hallway stretches before you, connecting the rooms of your small apartment. A cheap, metal coat rack leans against one wall, burdened with a couple of worn jackets. Beneath your feet, a faded welcome mat bears the ghost of a friendly greeting. The overhead light flickers intermittently, casting long, dancing shadows that accentuate the peeling paint. Muffled snippets of conversation and the rhythmic thump of a bassline drift in from the neighboring apartments, a constant reminder of the lives crammed into this building.
