name: First Floor Hallway
description: The first-floor hallway of the Affordable Apartments is a long, echoing space. Faded floral wallpaper peels away from the walls in strips, revealing patches of bare plaster. A row of identical apartment doors lines the corridor, each bearing its own unique scars and imperfections. A worn set of stairs leads upwards towards the roof, while another descends to the building's entrance. The air is thick with the smell of stale cooking and lingering dampness.
