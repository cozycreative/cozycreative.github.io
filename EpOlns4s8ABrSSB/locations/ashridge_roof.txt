name: Roof
The rooftop of the Affordable Apartments is a flat, tar-covered expanse, exposed to the elements. From this vantage point, you can take in a panoramic, if somewhat bleak, view of Ashridge. A low brick wall surrounds the perimeter, offering a modicum of safety. Scattered across the surface are remnants of past gatherings â€“ discarded cigarette butts, empty beer cans, and faded graffiti tags. The wind whips across the open space, carrying with it the distant sounds of the city.
