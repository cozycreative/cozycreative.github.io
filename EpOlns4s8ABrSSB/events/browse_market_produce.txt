The air is a heady mix of earthy aromas – ripe tomatoes, pungent herbs, and the slightly fermented scent of overripe berries. You spot bruised peaches nestled next to bright red peppers, wilted leafy greens alongside misshapen potatoes. It's a feast for the senses, if not always the most appealing sight."
